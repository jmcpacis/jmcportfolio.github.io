              mHealth, or the use of mobile technologies for health, has been widely recognized as a potential tool to improve health outcomes and access to health services, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where health systems face many challenges. In this blog post, we will explore how mHealth can be integrated at the point-of-care and support the self-management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, which are a major burden for LMICs. <br><br>
              1. Data collection and management: mHealth can facilitate the capture and transmission of patient data, such as vital signs, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, and integrate them with existing health information systems or electronic health records. <br>
              2. Clinical decision support: mHealth can provide health workers with evidence-based guidelines, algorithms, or protocols to assist them in diagnosing, treating, or referring patients, especially in remote or resource-limited settings where they may lack the necessary skills or equipment. <br>
              3. Communication and coordination: mHealth can enable health workers to communicate and collaborate with each other, or with patients, through voice, text, or video calls, or through social media platforms. <br><br>
              mHealth for self-management of NCDs refers to the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or wearable sensors, by patients or caregivers to monitor, manage, or prevent their chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular diseases. This can empower patients to take an active role in their own health by enabling: <br><br>
              1. Self-monitoring: mHealth can enable patients to measure and record their own health indicators, such as blood glucose, blood pressure, weight, or physical activity, using mobile devices or sensors that can connect to their smartphones. <br>
              2. Self-management: mHealth can provide patients with personalized feedback, education, or guidance on how to manage their conditions, such as medication adherence, diet, exercise, or stress management, based on their self-monitored data or preferences. <br>
              3. Self-care support: mHealth can connect patients with their health care providers, peers, or family members, who can provide them with support, advice, or motivation to manage their conditions, through voice, text, or video calls, or through social media platforms. <br><br>
              Despite the potential benefits of mHealth, there are also many challenges and barriers that hinder its implementation and scale-up, such as: <br>
              1. Sustainability: mHealth projects often depend on external funding. To ensure the sustainability of mHealth, it is important to demonstrate its value and impact, and to align it with the priorities and needs of the health system and the stakeholders. <br>
              2. Scalability: mHealth projects often operate in pilot or small-scale settings, which may not be representative or generalizable to the larger or diverse populations or contexts. To ensure the scalability of mHealth, it is important to consider the feasibility, acceptability, and adaptability of the intervention, and to involve the end-users and the decision-makers in the design and evaluation process.<br>
              3. Interoperability: mHealth projects often use different platforms, standards, or formats for data collection, storage, or exchange, which may not be compatible or integrated with each other or with the existing health information systems or electronic health records. To ensure the interoperability of mHealth, it is important to adopt common or harmonized standards, protocols, or architectures, and to ensure the security, privacy, and ethics of data. <br><br>
              Diabetes is one of the most prevalent and costly NCDs, affecting more than 400 million people worldwide, and accounting for more than 10% of the global health expenditure. mHealth can play a vital role in the prevention, detection, and management of diabetes, especially in LMICs where the burden is highest and the resources are scarce. <br><br>
              SMS, or short message service, is one of the simplest and most widely used forms of mHealth, which can deliver text messages to patients or health workers, containing information, reminders, or feedback on diabetes care. For example, a randomized controlled trial in Kenya showed that SMS improved medication adherence, glycemic control, and self-efficacy among patients with diabetes.<br><br>
              Smartphone apps are one of the most advanced and versatile forms of mHealth, which can provide various functions and features for diabetes care, such as data collection, analysis, visualization, feedback, education, or communication. <br><br>
