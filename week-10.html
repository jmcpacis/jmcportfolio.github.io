            Note bloat in the EMR has been defined as unnecessary, unorganized, or unclear information in a note.
            This is usually linked to the copy-paste functionality which has made it easier to add information found
            elsewhere in the EMR into the note, at the expense of readability and efficient team communication.
            This week’s driving question will take you through the issues of EMR documentation and its impact on
            physician efficiency and patient safety.<br> <br>

                Health information privacy is the right of individuals to control the access, use, and disclosure of their personal health data. It is an essential aspect of health care delivery, as it protects the dignity, autonomy, and confidentiality of patients. However, health information privacy also poses challenges and risks, especially in the context of the digital age, where data can be easily collected, stored, shared, and analyzed by various entities. <br><br>
                Privacy and confidentiality are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings and implications. Privacy is the right of individuals to decide who can access their personal information, while confidentiality is the duty of the entities that hold or process personal information to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. <br><br>
                The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA) is the primary law that governs the collection, processing, and protection of personal data in the Philippines. It was enacted to comply with the international standards of data protection, and to promote the growth of the information and communications technology sector in the country.<br>
                The DPA applies to all types of personal data, including health data, which is defined as “any information, whether recorded in a material form or not, from which the identity of an individual is apparent or can be reasonably and directly ascertained by the entity holding the information, or when put together with other information would directly and certainly identify an individual” (Section 3(g) of the DPA). <br><br>
                The DPA provides several provisions that protect the privacy and security of health data, such as:<br>
                1. The principle of consent, which requires the data subject’s consent. <br>
                2. The principle of transparency, which requires the data controller (the entity that decides how and why personal data is processed) to inform the data subject of the nature, purpose, and extent of the processing of their personal data, as well as the rights and remedies available to them. <br>
                3. The principle of proportionality. <br>
                4. The principle of accountability, which requires the data controller to implement reasonable and appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures to protect personal data against any accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration, disclosure, or access. <br> <br>
                However, the DPA does not apply to the following types of health data, as specified in Section 4 of the DPA: <br>
                1. Personal data processed for journalistic, artistic, literary, or research purposes, provided that the data controller abides by the ethical standards of these fields and does not violate the rights and freedoms of the data subject. <br>
                2. Personal data processed for the needs of scientific and statistical research, provided that the data controller ensures that the data is not used to support measures or decisions regarding any particular individual, and that the data is anonymized or pseudonymized before publication or dissemination. <br>
                3. Personal data processed by an individual for personal or domestic purposes, provided that no harm is caused to the data subject or any third party. <br> <br>
                Electronic health records (EHR) are digital versions of the medical records of patients, which can be accessed and shared by authorized health care providers across different settings and locations. EHR can improve the quality, efficiency, and safety of health care delivery, but they also pose risks to the privacy and security of health data, especially in the face of cyberattacks, data breaches, and human errors.<br>
                To secure EHR data, the following techniques can be employed: <br>
                1. Encryption, which is the process of transforming data into an unreadable form using a secret key, so that only authorized parties can decrypt and access the data. <br>
                2. Authentication, which is the process of verifying the identity of the user or device that is accessing the data, using methods such as passwords, biometrics, tokens, or certificates.<br>
                3. Authorization, which is the process of granting or denying access to the data based on the user’s role, privileges, and permissions. <br><br>
                Health data privacy and security are important issues that affect the health sector and the society as a whole. The DPA provides a general framework for the protection of personal data in the Philippines, but it does not address the specific issues and challenges related to health data, such as the sensitivity and complexity of health data, which may include genetic, biometric, mental, sexual, or reproductive information, etc.
                The diversity and multiplicity of the stakeholders involved, and the interoperability and standardization of the health data systems. <br><br>
                Therefore, there is a need for a health data-specific regulation in the Philippines, similar to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which sets the standards and rules for the privacy and security of health data, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the data subjects and the data controllers.<br><br>
